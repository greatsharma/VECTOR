# VECTOR

#### Description: 
                This project consists of creation of a vectors using c++.
                so anyone having idea with a minimum of C++03 is good to go. The idea of this project
                is to create custom vectors using c++ which behaves in similar manner to the standard
                vectors introduced in c++11.The project consists some basic operations for vectors for
                only integers right now.
                The entire project is created in Microsoft Visual Studio 2017, so anyone having MVS
                can directly view it by opening selfVector.sln. But the one not having having MVS I
                strongly recommend to install it as it seems very professional to work with and is
                also very handy but if you insists using other IDEs or code editors then you just 
                need header and source folders inside selfVector folder. 
                
#### Prerequisites: 
                Atleast C++03, Pointers, realloc and OOP .
